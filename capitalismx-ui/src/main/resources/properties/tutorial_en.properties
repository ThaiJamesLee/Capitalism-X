# Chapter explaining the hud controls
chapter.controls.hud.welcome=Welcome to the tutorial. \nAt first take a look at the GameHud which provides the most important informations. \nOn top you see what department you currently view. \nThe overview is the map of your company, change perspective if you want.
chapter.controls.hud.date=On the top left you see the current date.
chapter.controls.hud.pause=You can pause and continue the game here. \nIt might be a good idea to do so for the rest of this tutorial.
chapter.controls.hud.networth=On the bottom some KPIs are monitored. First one is the networth of your company. Should be self explanatory...
chapter.controls.hud.cash=Next one is Cash, not much more complicated. Below you can see how your last actions have changed this metric
chapter.controls.hud.employees=This one shows how many employees you have. Still a lot room for improvement I see.
chapter.controls.hud.eco=The last one displays the EcoIndex, which is actually quite complicated. So we will come back to that later. Just remember that most of your actions can influence it and that pollution can fire back!
chapter.controls.hud.speed=Use this button to change game speed.
chapter.controls.hud.skip=By clicking here you can skip a week
chapter.controls.hud.messages=In the top right corner you can access you mailbox. Not much there yet, but it will become important for you later.)
